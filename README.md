# CSCI3010-Cancer-Detection-Final-Project
In this project, we aimed to develop and evaluate machine learning models for the classification of breast cancer diagnoses using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset. This dataset is widely used in the medical field and contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) breast mass. The dataset includes 569 samples, each with 30 features that describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images.

The primary goal of this project was to accurately classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant. The diagnosis column in the dataset, which indicates whether the tumor is benign (B) or malignant (M), was our target variable. To facilitate model training and evaluation, we converted the categorical diagnosis labels into numerical values (0 for benign and 1 for malignant).

We employed two different machine learning techniques to tackle this classification problem: a sequential neural network and a support vector machine (SVM). The sequential neural network consisted of dense layers, dropout layers for regularization, and ReLU and sigmoid activation functions. The SVM was used with a linear kernel after standardizing the features. Both models were trained and evaluated on the dataset, and their performance was compared using metrics such as accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and F1 score.

Through this project, we demonstrated the application of advanced machine learning techniques to a critical medical diagnosis problem, highlighting the importance of accurate and reliable classification models in the early detection and treatment of breast cancer.
